# Onboarding_1.0
Onboarding task 1.0, API and GitHub Actions

## Objective

Build a simple Node.js API using FeathersJS (in **TypeScript**), add tests, and integrate GitHub Actions for automated testing and code coverage.

---

## Why

- Learn how to build and structure a basic **FeathersJS API**.
- Gain hands-on experience with **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration.
- Practice working with **TypeScript** in a real-world project setup.

---

## Task Steps

1. **Repository**
    - Create a new **public GitHub repository** in your personal account.
    - Add a basic README with project setup instructions.
2. **API**
    - Build a minimal FeathersJS API in **TypeScript**.
    - Implement CRUD for a simple resource (e.g., `todo` items with `title` and `completed` fields).
3. **Tests**
    - Write unit/integration tests to cover the CRUD operations.
    - Aim for at least 80% coverage.
4. **GitHub Actions**
    - Add a workflow that:
        - Runs on pushes and pull requests.
        - Installs dependencies, lints, and runs the tests.
        - Generates a coverage report.
5. **Coverage Reporting**
    - Integrate a free coverage service (e.g., Codecov).
